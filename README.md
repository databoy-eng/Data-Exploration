# Plagiarism Text Data

In this project, you will be tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar the text file is when compared to a provided source text. 

The first step in working with any dataset is loading the data in and noting what information is included in the dataset. This is an important step in eventually working with this data, and knowing what kinds of features you have to work with as you transform and group the data!

So, this notebook is all about exploring the data and noting patterns about the features you are given and the distribution of data.
